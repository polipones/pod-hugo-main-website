## About our club

Student’s club Pod-O-Lee was established in 1998 and currently is the second largest club of the [CTU Student Union](https://su.cvut.cz/). The club is completely run by student volunteers, who decided to grab this wonderful opportunity to enhance their work experience.

We will be happy to welcome foreign students among us as well, thus feel free to contact us. You can join our club management, IT team, Gym administration, PR department, HR department and many others.

We do not just provide the internet connection, we also take care of providing enough opportunities for you to enjoy free time activities. You can visit our music rehearsal studio, our famous Pod-O-Gym, our new workroom Pod-O-Lab and many others.

On top of that, we organise various social, cultural and sports events.
However, the Podolí dormitory is property of [Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU)](https://cvut.cz/). It is being administered by [SUZ ČVUT (The Service Facilities Administration of the Czech Technical University in Prague)](https://www.suz.cvut.cz/koleje/koleje-podoli) throughout the whole year.

Please, if you find a defect anywhere in the Podolí dormitory, use the [defect reporting system](https://web.suz.cvut.cz/KnihaZavad) in ISKAM (menu Accommodation -> Defect log).

Access to Hydra is [here](https://hydra.pod.cvut.cz/). You can find what membiership you have paid and for how long or which of your devices are registered to our network.

## First day

Shortly before the start of the semester, there are mass arrivals to the dormitory where you will be accommodated by the CTU SÚZ. When you check in, you will also come across our information booth where we will inform you about the club's operations.

It will take some time to complete the check-in process. From the morning, there are usually large queues of students outside the accommodation office (you can get to it from the reception), and this is usually the case throughout the week. There is an assistant in the reception who will provide a serial number on request. You'd better take this or you'll be waiting there until the evening.

For the accommodation office you need:
- ID or passport
- a small photo for your dorm card
- proof of studies (only if you are not a student at the CTU)

Also think about what things you want to insure against theft (at the reception you will get a sheet where you fill in what you want to insure). We **highly recommend** that you get at least a laptop/PC (plus some other more expensive items) insured. It costs a few crowns and you'll be glad you have it insured in case something gets lost.

However, if you're moving in outside of the mass boarding period, feel free to visit or contact club members on your block ([Contacts]({{< ref "/contacts">}})).
