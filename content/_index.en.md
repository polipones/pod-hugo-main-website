Student’s club Pod-O-Lee was established in 1998 and currently is the second largest club of the [CTU Student Union](https://su.cvut.cz/). The club is completely run by student volunteers, who decided to grab this wonderful opportunity to enhance their work experience.

We will be happy to welcome foreign students among us as well, thus feel free to contact us. You can join our club management, IT team, Gym administration, PR department, HR department and many others.

We do not just provide the internet connection, we also take care of providing enough opportunities for you to enjoy free time activities. You can visit our music rehearsal studio, our famous Pod-O-Gym, our new workroom Pod-O-Lab and many others.

On top of that, we organise various social, cultural and sports events.
However, the Podolí dormitory is property of [CTU](https://cvut.cz/). It is being administered by [SUZ ČVUT (The Service Facilities Administration of the Czech Technical University in Prague)](https://www.suz.cvut.cz/koleje/koleje-podoli) throughout the whole year.

Please, if you find a defect anywhere in the Podolí dormitory, use the [defect reporting system](https://www.suz.cvut.cz/intranet) to let us know.

I guess you are hungry after all the reading. Just check the daily [menu](https://agata.suz.cvut.cz/jidelnicky/index.php?clPodsystem=4) of our [canteen](https://www.suz.cvut.cz/menzy/menza-podoli). Or simply go there right away, our canteen is only a few steps away from your room, in the building with the huge sign saying “MENZA”.

If you have any kind of problem with paying for club membership, please write email to <platby@pod.cvut.cz>.
