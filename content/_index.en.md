## About our club

Student’s club Pod-O-Lee was established in 1998 and currently is the second largest club of the [CTU Student Union](https://su.cvut.cz/). The club is completely run by student volunteers, who decided to grab this wonderful opportunity to enhance their work experience.

We will be happy to welcome foreign students among us as well, thus feel free to contact us. You can join our club management, IT team, Gym administration, PR department, HR department and many others.

We do not just provide the internet connection, we also take care of providing enough opportunities for you to enjoy free time activities. You can visit our music rehearsal studio, our famous Pod-O-Gym, our new workroom Pod-O-Lab and many others.

On top of that, we organise various social, cultural and sports events.
However, the Podolí dormitory is property of [Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU)](https://cvut.cz/). It is being administered by [SUZ ČVUT (The Service Facilities Administration of the Czech Technical University in Prague)](https://www.suz.cvut.cz/koleje/koleje-podoli) throughout the whole year.

Please, if you find a defect anywhere in the Podolí dormitory, use the [defect reporting system](https://web.suz.cvut.cz/KnihaZavad) in ISKAM (menu Accommodation -> Defect log).

Access to Hydra is [here](https://hydra.pod.cvut.cz/). You can find what membiership you have paid and for how long or which of your devices are registered to our network.
