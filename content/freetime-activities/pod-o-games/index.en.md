The room is equipped with a 4K projector to which you can also connect your own PC and watch a movie. Sound is delivered by Bose speakers, so we apologize to everyone above the gaming room. There are also a handful of fatboys and a convertible couch. We also have racing seat Playseat Fanatec, in which you can enjoy racing games.
