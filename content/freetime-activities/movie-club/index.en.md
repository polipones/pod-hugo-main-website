The Film Club was founded to show the diversity of the film world to the residents of Podolí dormitory. Every Tuesday we show films of various genres, from cult series like Godfather to black and white classics including comedies and westerns. Each film is followed by a discussion of what everyone liked and what they think was interesting in the movie.

We also held a weekend marathon of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, which were accompanied by refreshments. The programme for the semester is always posted on the bulletin boards of the dormitory blocks.
