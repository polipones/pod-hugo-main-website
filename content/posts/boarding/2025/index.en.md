Hi,

I would like to wish you good luck in the new academic year 2025/2026, I believe that in addition to staying together in the same dormitory we will create many memories and experience many good events :)

Together with the beginning of the year I would like to remind you of the necessity of confirmation that you are a resident of Podolí Dormitory.

To do so is at the club stand, which we will have at the entrance to the campus every working day from 8:00 to 14:00 at the time of regular boarding to the campus (i.e. until 19.9.2025). To present yourself, you only need a dormcard or an accommodation contract for AR 2025/2026. Alternatively, you can arrange verification at our televisions, you can find their contacts here: https://podolee.cz/en/contacts/ 

If you have registered for the club this September (9/2025) or you have already done so, the obligation to prove it does not apply to you. If you are not currently at the campus, we can solve everything when you return with our televisions :)

Along with this, I invite you to beer and limo, which you can have at our stand (again on weekdays from 8:00 to 14:00). Either bring your own cup or you can get our returnable cup Pod-O-Lee for 50 CZK (in cash).

I wish you a beautiful September and a lot of success with your studies.

Kateřina Pilná  
chairman club Pod-O-Lee
