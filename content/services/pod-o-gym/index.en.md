### Boulder

Instructor contact information: [Bouldering section in contacts]({{< ref "/contacts#boulder" >}}).

For those interested in bouldering and climbing, we also have a small bouldering wall in the gym. If you’re new to it and want to try it, feel free to reach out to the instructors -- they’ll help you with the basics and show you how to prevent injuries. All bouldering participants must meet the standard requirements for access to Pod-O-Gym, including familiarizing themselves with the operating rules.

Our bouldering instructors maintain the wall; contact details are available in [Contacts]({{< ref "/contacts#boulder" >}}). For issues or questions, write to <sportoviste@pod.cvut.cz>.

The boulder is divided into 2 sections: [Classic boulders](#classic-boulders) and [Spray Wall](#spray-wall).

#### Classic Boulders

One color designates a boulder. Two tapes indicate the starting hold (both hands on one hold) or two holds (one hand on each hold). One tape marks the end of the boulder -- called the TOP.

Start from the initial hold/holds. Once your entire body is in the air, you can reach for additional holds. The boulder is considered climbed when you reach the top hold of the same color and hold it with both hands for about 3 seconds.

#### Spray Wall

The rules for bouldering here are the same, but this section allows you to show your creativity by creating your own boulders and sharing them with other climbers through a mobile app.

For Android phones, download the [Boulder Problems](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asturias.pablo.pasos) app and search for the **PodoGym** room. If you have iOS, you’ll need to use this link in your browser: <https://boulderproblems.tk/boulderroom/2255>. You’ll need to register to add new boulders.

#### Boulder Problems App

You can browse, climb, and check off boulders added by other climbers. You can also create your own boulders to add more fun and challenge to the training.

To create a new boulder, take a picture of the wall and circle the holds that are part of your boulder (each type of circle indicates something different -- start, top, feet, hands, etc.). Add a name, difficulty level, publish, and watch who climbs your boulder.

#### Difficulty

We will use the French scale with difficulty levels from 1 to 9, a to c (we'll likely stay within 3 to 7).

In short (hopefully self-explanatory):

- 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 …
- a < b < c
- so -- 5a < 5b < 5c < 6a < 6b …

Sometimes a + sign may appear, indicating, for example: 5a < 5a+ < 5b.

### Regular and occasional courses

Every semester there are some courses in our gym. Courses are free and conducted by enthusiasts from our gym.

The most important one from occasional courses is "How to train". This one hour course is usually held on the start of every new academic year. So if you are not sure how to start in the gym, or you do not have partner for training, you might just find answers to both in this course.
