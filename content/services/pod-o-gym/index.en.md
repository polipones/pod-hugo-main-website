### Boulder

Contact instructors: [Boulder section in contacts]({{< ref "/contacts#boulder" >}}).

For those interested in bouldering and climbing, we also have a smaller boulder in the gym. If you don't know how to do it but would like to try bouldering, don't hesitate to contact the instructors, who will help you with the basics and advise you on how to prevent injuries. Everyone who wants to visit the boulder area must meet all the requirements for normal access to Pod-O-Gym, including familiarization with the operating rules.

Our climbing instructors take care of the bouldering area. You can find their contact details in [Contacts]({{< ref "/contacts#boulder" >}}). If you have any problems or questions, please write to <sportoviste@pod.cvut.cz>.

The boulder area is divided into two parts, [Classic Boulders](#classic-boulders) and [Spray Wall](#spray-wall).

#### Classic boulders

- One color indicates a boulder
- Two tapes indicate the starting hold (both hands on one hold) or two holds (each hand on one hold)
- One tape indicates the end of the boulder – the so-called TOP
- You start from the starting hold(s). Only when your whole body is in the air can you grab the next holds. The boulder is considered climbed when you reach the top hold after climbing along one color and touch it with both hands for about 3 seconds

#### Spray Wall

- An ideal part of the boulder where you can show your creativity, come up with your own boulders, and share them with other climbers in the mobile app
- The rules of bouldering in this section are the same
- To view the boulders, download the **Boulder Creator** app (black and red) and search for the PodoGym room


##### What can you do with the Boulder Creator app?

- Browse, climb, check off, and rate the classification of boulders already climbed by other climbers
- Create your own boulders -> publish them and make training more enjoyable for others by giving them the opportunity to climb your ideas

##### Creating boulders

- Take a photo of the wall and circle the holds that are part of your boulder in the app (each type of circle indicates something different – start, top, feet, hands, etc.)
- Add a name, difficulty, and optional characteristics of the boulder
- Publish and see who climbs your boulder

##### Climbing

- You can check off which boulders you have already climbed in the app and on how many attempts – this is useful if you are forgetful and don't want to climb something twice

#### Difficulty

- We will use the French scale
- Difficulty 1–9, a–c (we will probably range between 3 and 7)
- In short (hopefully everyone will understand):
- 3<4<5<6…
    - a<b<c
- Therefore: 5a<5b<5c<6a<6b...
- Occasionally, a + sign may appear
- 5a<5a+<5b
- In the Boulder Creator app
    - The difficulty is 4,5,5+ and then the same as the French scale (5+ represents approximately 5b to 5c+)

#### Problems

If you have any problems or questions, please email <j.karban@pod.cvut.cz> or <v.janacek@pod.cvut.cz>.

### Regular and occasional courses

Every semester there are some courses in our gym. Courses are free and conducted by enthusiasts from our gym.

The most important one from occasional courses is "How to train". This one hour course is usually held on the start of every new academic year. So if you are not sure how to start in the gym, or you do not have partner for training, you might just find answers to both in this course.
