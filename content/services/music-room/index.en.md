## Registration process

### Dormitory residents

#### Already a club member?

Ask a televizor to give you the 10 day free access trial. If you do not have your card connected to your Hydra account, go to the Music room and scan it 5 times via the scanner and remember the scanning time. Then visit any televizor to finish the process.

If you already have your card connected to your Hydra account, you only need to go through the [Music room Operating rules]({{< ref "#operating-rules" >}}) and enjoy your stay at the Music room. Just do not forget to make the [Music room payment]({{< ref "/payments/index.md" >}}) after your free trial and keep enjoying!

#### Not a club member just yet?

Before the club registration process itself visit the Music room and scan the card 5 times via the card reader next to the door and remember the scanning time. Seek a televizor afterwards and he or she will guide you through the rest of the process.

### Not a dormitory resident

Unfortunately, we cannot accept non-residents because the music room is inside the dorm block without external access.
