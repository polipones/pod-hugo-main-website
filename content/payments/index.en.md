If you have any problems with paying club’s membership, write email to <platby@pod.cvut.cz>.

## Payment information

If you want to use benefits of club Pod-O-Lee, you have to pay fees every six months (payment season) of the calendar year and have active membership (see [Internal and external membership](#internal-and-external-membership) below).

- For first half of a year you can pay from 1. January to 30. June with validity of the membership to 30. September.
- For second half of a year you can pay from 1. July to 31. December with validity of the membership to 28. February (of the next year).

We would like to remind you that money transfer via bank account may take up to 3 days. If the payment won’t transfer up to the last day of payment season, as written above, you lose access to all benefits until the transfer is finished. It is therefore better to not wait until the last day of payment season. If you used instant payment, transfer should be processed by Hydra in few minutes.

## How to pay

**We strongly recommend using payment QR code generator in Hydra, accessible after login [HERE](https://hydra.pod.cvut.cz/membership/payments).**

More traditionally:

- Transfer via bank account (recommended)
- Via cash in one of Fio bank branches (fee is 90 Kč)
- Via cash in some other bank branches (not recommended, other banks might ask for higher fees)

Payment via postal order **is not possible** – all such payments will be ignored

**We can accept only payments in Czech crowns and in exact amounts (see amounts below). Anything else have to be returned and it costs us and you additional time and sometimes money (fees).**

## For payment you need to know

Bank account number: **99919040/2010**

Prices of the benefits and specific symbols (SS) for each benefit:

- Basic Membership – 1000 Kč, specific symbol: 1 (necessary for other memberships, alone provides access to academical network, access to PC room, ability to borrow grill and beer tap, ...)
- Pod-O-Gym – 1000 Kč, specific symbol: 2 (provides access to Pod-O-Gym and sauna)
- Musical Room – 500 Kč, specific symbol: 3 (provides access to music room)

Variable symbol: To access this number you will have to login to your Hydra account. It is your Hydra ID.

**Use of ANY benefit is under a condition of paying the Basic Membership and having active membership.**

If you want to use more than one benefit and you want to pay together simply add together the individual fees for each benefit.
For example: You want to use Internet and Gym then add 1000 Kč + 1000 Kč for Basic Membership = 2000 Kč. And for specific symbol write: 12

## Signature of the Club’s Membership

Every new member will be introduced to the rules and regulations of the club Pod-O-Lee. Understanding of these rules he will then confirm with his signature on the document. With this signature he is also giving a permission to the club Pod-O-Lee to handle his personal informations. Validity of your signature is 7 years. Using any benefit is under a condition you had in fact registered and signed this document.

These documents are available at “televizors”. Televizors are people who are handling registrations for benefits and internet problems. Every block (A-F) has list of them opposite to the main entrance on a board or complete up-to-date list is in [contacts]({{< ref "/contacts/index.md" >}}).

## Internal and external membership

According to [IP13/2024](https://wiki.pod.cvut.cz/_media/legislativa/ip_13-2024_-_clenstvi_klubu_pod-o-lee.pdf), the Pod-O-Lee club has internal and external memberships.

### Internal Membership

An internal member is a person who is a member of the Pod-O-Lee club according to the valid statutes of the club and has a valid accommodation contract with the CTU Dormitory Administration (SÚZ ČVUT) for the Podolí dormitory. To obtain internal membership, the person must present a valid accommodation contract, or a valid dormitory card.

**Membership is valid only for one period and must be renewed for each new period.**

### External Membership

An external member is a person who is a member of the Pod-O-Lee club according to the valid statutes of the club, **does not** have a valid accommodation contract with the CTU Dormitory Administration (SÚZ ČVUT) for the Podolí dormitory, but has approved external membership from the president of the Pod-O-Lee club and from the manager of the given benefit.

For more information about both types of membership, read [IP13/2024](https://wiki.pod.cvut.cz/_media/legislativa/ip_13-2024_-_clenstvi_klubu_pod-o-lee.pdf) (Czech only).
