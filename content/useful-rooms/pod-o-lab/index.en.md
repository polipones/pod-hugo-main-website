The Pod-O-Lab is located in two rooms on the ground floor of Block E. The first room is mainly a mechanical lab, while the second room is for 3D printing and electronics.

Lab is open by appointment with administrators and team members by email [lab@pod.cvut.cz](mailto:lab@pod.cvut.cz) and we kindly welcome every member of the club.

## Mechanical lab

In the mechanical lab, you can create anything you can think of. We have quite a few drill bits for both wood and iron, and we also have a nice range of taps. Socket wrench set, angle grinder, and bit set are also here. If something doesn't want to cooperate, we can help it with a crowbar, a couple of sizes of hammers, both wood and iron saws, a proxxon, a 230 drill, or a hacksaw.
A bench drill, a shucker, files, sheet metal shears, and a compressor can also make our lives much easier. We have scribing tools, a dimple, a calliper or fine files for precise measurements. To maintain proper conditions, we have both a WD and brake cleaner, brushes, a pile of rags, gloves, and a nice collection of zip ties, tapes, and protective gear. Come and see us; there's always a way to take something apart into pieces or vice versa.

## Electrical lab

In the second room of the lab, it is possible to work on electronics thanks to equipment such as laboratory power sources, oscilloscope, signal generator, soldering iron, hot air station, etc. Building your projects for fun or even school projects is not a problem here. Of course, the lab is connected to the club's network, including our computer, with all the necessary software, including software for logging from the instruments. We can handle programming microcontrollers, too. Whatever you come up with, you'll find the ideal conditions in the lab to complete your project, whether it's a 555 flasher or a thesis.

## 3D printing

{{<figure src="3dprint.jpg" alt="3D printing">}}

There is a 3D printing corner in the electric lab. We currently have three 3D printers. Two of the more widespread FDM technology namely the Průša MK3S and the older Poseidon Duo dual-extruder printer. The third printer is the Průša SL1 resin (SLA) printer, and its companion is the Průša CW1 rinse station. If you need to print a part or figure for D'n'D, feel free to contact us, but for larger prints, please bring your filament or resin.

## Operating rules

Operating rules are temporarily available via mail [lab@pod.cvut.cz](mailto:lab@pod.cvut.cz).
